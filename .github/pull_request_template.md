## Title

The PR's title should be prefixed with one of the following types:

- build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- docs: Documentation only changes
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
  formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

PRs that include breaking changes (e.g. dependency on a new major version of the
API) should add a exclamation mark after the type

e.g.

```
build: update NPM dependencies
feat!: add import contact form
fix: correctly submit new contact's name on update
```
